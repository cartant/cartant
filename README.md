I build stuff.

Tools and libraries mostly. Hopefully, stuff that makes development less tedious and developers more productive.

I'm on the RxJS core team and I've written a bunch of articles about RxJS and TypeScript. You can find them on my blog: [ncjamieson.com](https://ncjamieson.com)

You can sponsor my work through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/cartant).
